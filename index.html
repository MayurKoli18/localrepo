•	"Hello World" Program: Write a program that simply prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console.
•	Add Two Numbers: Write a program that takes two integer inputs from a user and prints their sum.
•	Even or Odd: Write a program that reads an integer from the user and determines whether it is an even or an odd number. 
Control Flow and Logic Problems 
•	Leap Year Check: Write a program that takes a year as input and checks if it is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.
•	Factorial Calculation: Write a program that computes the factorial of a given non-negative integer. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n (e.g., 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120).
•	Greatest of Three Numbers: Write a program that takes three numbers from the user and prints the greatest among them. 
Array and String Problems
•	Reverse a String: Write a program that accepts a string input from the user and prints the reversed string.
•	Sum of Array Elements: Write a program that defines an array of integers and calculates the sum of all elements in the array.
•	Find Maximum and Minimum: Write a program to find the largest and smallest elements in a given array of integers.
